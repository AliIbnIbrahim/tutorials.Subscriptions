  	<blockquote>
<p>'Another sandwich!' said the King.</p>
<p>'There's nothing but hay left now,' the Messenger said, peeping into the bag.</p>
<p>'Hay, then,' the King murmured in a faint whisper.</p>
<p>Alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. 'There's nothing like eating hay when you're faint,' he remarked to her, as he munched away.</p>
<p>â€” Lewis Carroll (Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There)</p>
